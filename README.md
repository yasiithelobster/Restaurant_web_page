# Restaurant Website - HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This is a dynamic, multi-page restaurant website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML. It was developed as part of my first-year coursework for the BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science degree at Informatics Institute of Technology.

## 🌟 Features

- 🌐 **Interactive Navigation Bar** – Quickly switch between sections of the site
- 🍔 **Menu Filtering** – Filter food items by category (e.g., Breakfast, Desserts)
- 📝 **Online Order Form** – Users can submit orders through a form
- ⭐ **Review on Hover** – View customer reviews by hovering over menu items
- 🧾 **Menu from XML** – Menu items are dynamically loaded from an XML file

## 💡 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- XML (for dynamic menu loading)

## ⚙️ How to Run

> **Important:** Due to browser restrictions, the XML file won’t load properly unless served from a local server.

### 🖥️ Option 1: Using VS Code with Live Server

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click `index.html` → click **“Open with Live Server”**.
4. The website will launch in your browser with full functionality.

### 🌐 Option 2: Manual Server

If you're not using VS Code:

```bash
# Python 3 simple HTTP server (run inside your project folder)
python -m http.server
```
